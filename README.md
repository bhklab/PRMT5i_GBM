# PRMT5i GBM

## Introduction
This is a project to process sensitivity data in this paper:

A PRMT5 Brain Penetrant Inhibitor Disrupts Growth of a Diversity of Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Stem Cells, 2019, Sachamitr et. al..

The script for the analysis is written in R.


----

## Dependencies:
These R packages need to be installed in order to run the analysis script:
- IncucyteDRC
- PharmacoGx


----
## Reproducibility of the Analysis:
- Once the project is downloaded to the user computer, the user needs to navigate to the main directory of the project "PRMT5i_GBM-master".
- Inside the main directory, there is an R script file named "PRMT5i_GBM_drug_response_processing.R". Running this script will regenerate the senisitvity data of applying PRMT5i to GBM lines in this paper.

**Important Note:** the user needs to set the working directory inside the script file before running it, i.e. setting the working directory to "PRMT5i_GBM-master"
